# Personal README

__What is this?__

Think of this as documentation for Matthew Root. Its intended purpose is to accelerate your understanding of me as a human and Engineering Manager and to provide insight into what our working relationship will look like. It is __not__ intended as a substitute for getting to know me. Building a relationship, in real life, is one of the most important things we'll do together. This README should be used as a supplement and a guide rather than a replacement for that.

## Management Philosophy

The following are the core tenets that provide the foundation for how I prefer to manage. I strive to adhere to these all the time. If you ever find me to be in violation of one of these ideas, please point it out to me. That will help me do better in the future.

* __Measuring stick for success:__ Can someone go out and get a better role after you’ve been their manager? You’ve got to care about the development of people to your core. Make your direct reports your highest priority.
* __Put people and the team first:__ Constantly ask, what can I do to be most helpful to you or the team? The most helpful thing you can do may be totally different day-to-day, week-to-week, person-to-person, or team-to-team. Default to the assumption that you’re the worst on the team and treat everyone else like they’re more awesome than you. If you’ve hired right, that will be true.
* __Constant improvement:__ Make this a fundamental value for both individuals and the team itself. Don’t set anything in stone. Don’t assume you’re ever doing something perfect. When you’ve made one improvement, move onto the next thing. Repeat forever.
* __How to move mountains:__ Give a properly motivated team a high degree of trust and autonomy.
* __Achieving motivation:__ Help everyone understand the value of what the team is doing and what they as an individual are doing. Make sure everyone knows priorities and reasoning behind them. Be transparent and honest about goals. Keep their growth central to your focus and make it a part of their everyday life.
* __Autonomy:__ Let teams decide for themselves how they best operate. Actively seek out new ideas. When someone has an idea, consider it with an open mind and err on the side of trying new things. You can always revert if something doesn’t work. Don’t micromanage someone’s day or their work.
* __Create a safe and comfortable psychological space__: Strive to craft this work environment for engineers and teams. Encourage them to share their ideas. Listen to those opinions//feedback. Take action on what you’re hearing. Foster a culture of blameless criticism.
* __Management is important and valuable__: I've been fortunate to have great managers that I've learned so much from. I try to provide that experience to everyone I work with. I’ve also seen the negative impacts of bad management and lack of management.
* __Feedback is vital:__ Give pointed, direct feedback on a regular basis. Don’t wait for an annual review to help someone improve. Try to generalize negative feedback and be specific with positive feedback. Additionally, seek out feedback from those you work with, in all directions, in order to drive your own growth.
* __Diverse teams make the best decisions__: This may seem obvious but software industry demographics indicate it is not. Seek out a variety of backgrounds and talent profiles when building a team.

## Expectations

### What you can expect from me

Here is a short list of what behaviors you should expect from me at all times. If I'm ever failing to meet any of the expectations outlined in this section, please let me know immediately. This is not an exhaustive list of expectations but aims to cover those that are most vital.

#### You will be a top priority

It's my belief that the people who report to me are _the job_. I'm tasked with various other responsibilities as an Engineering Manager but none are higher priority in my view than ensuring my direct reports are getting what they need to be successful. In practice, this means you should expect that I will make time for you when you need it, follow through on commitments I make to you, and help you deal with whatever challenges you encounter.

#### Give my best in everything I do

This is a foundational principle for how I approach everything in my life. If I'm going to do something, I try to do it as well as I can. This doesn't mean that I will always deliver outstanding results, just that I'll aim to do my best. In practice, this means you should expect me to give you a great effort on every front from our 1:1 meetings to performance evaluations to helping you navigate challenges.

#### Default to transparent

I believe organizations operate at their highest level when information is not restricted. In the interest of this, I commit to being transparent and to proactively share as much as I can. The flip side of this is that you should feel epowered to ask me for information. The two important exceptions to this policy of transparency which I will always keep confidential are sensitive personal information and conversations around performance.

#### Default to trust

Simply put, I'll trust you until you give me a reason not to. I want my direct reports to have a lot of autonomy and that's only possible when paired with trust. You shouldn't find me micromanaging your work, schedule, or decision-making. I'll likely ask you a lot of probing questions but this is generally due to curiosity or a desire to gain more context.

#### Feedback will be delivered in a timely fashion

Giving feedback, both positive and constructive, is one of the most important functions I perform in my role as a manager. Since feedback has such high value, not giving it to you as soon as I have it would be doing you a disservice. You'll often find me giving you feedback right away, in the moment when I perceive something. When it's not possible to provide that realtime feedback or when I come to have feedback outside of direct interactions with you, I will provide this to you in our next 1:1. It's my goal for you to always know how you're doing. If there are surprises for you in a performance feedback loop, it's an indication that I'm not being effective at this.

#### Pointing you in the right direction

When you need it, I'll help get you oriented in the right direction. In the event that I don't know what that is, I'll either identify someone who will or commit to coming back to you with an answer.

### What I expect of you

#### Give your best in everything you do

If you're going to do something, do it as well as you can. I don't expect that outcomes or results will be perfect, just that you'll give your best effort. When you find yourself not striving to do your best on something, I encourage that you take a step back and examine why that is. Perhaps it's not an activity you should be spending your time on.

#### Try to get better every day

It's important for you to prioritize your growth. When you become more capable and can rise to new challenges it benefits you (better career opportunities), me (my success is based on your increasing success), and our employer (solving bigger problems, higher productivity, etc). You may not succeed in improving every day but, if that's your goal, it's likely to happen more days than not. Making this type of incremental daily progress leads to noticeable improvement in weeks, a significant change in months, and a radical difference over the course of a year. Get a little bit better every day and don't ever quit. Therein lies the path to greatness.

#### Act like an owner

Treat our software, team, Engineering organization, and company like you own it. If you've got equity, the latter will be literally true, but this means more than that. It's about acting like an owner and caring about what goes on in a way that you would if it was entirely yours. When you see a problem, call it out. If you've got a solution, suggest it. Help us push forward on more fronts than just building software.

#### Don't accept status quo

Nothing that we've created to this point, from software to processes to structures, is perfect and cannot be improved upon. Don't assume that present state is the correct future state. The opposite is generally true for software startups as they grow. Most of what we've done in the past will need to evolve or be replaced with something better along the way. Try to see with [beginner's eyes](ADD LINK) and continually examine how we could be doing better, everywhere.

#### Don't withhold feedback for me

Feedback is equally important for me to receive. Positive feedback helps me to validate my methods and, because I'm a human, it also feels good. Constructive feedback gives me insight into how I can improve. Regardless of the type of feedback you may have for me, know that I view it as a gift and am eager to have it. I typically try to solicit your feedback directly on a wide range of topics in our 1:1s but I may not always hit upon an area where you have feedback for me. Because of this, it's important that you take the initiative as necessary. Getting your feedback in a timely manner is also quite important. If something isn't going well, I prefer to make a change quickly rather than to have the problem fester.

Here's a model for getting to a place of comfort in giving feedback that I think is great (include ref):

1. thing
1. thing
1. thing

It will be my goal to build and maintain a relationship of trust with you so that you remain open to engaging in challenging discussions with me. However, if for any reason you have feedback for me that you don't feel comfortable addressing with me directly, please use this [anonymous feedback form](ADD LINK).

### Balancing life and work

I believe that it's important to find a healthy balance between work and the rest of life. I want this balance for both of us.

There's so much more to living a fulfilling life than success at work. Let's work hard while we're here and focus on life when we're not. To make you more comfortable about pursuing this balance, I'll endeavor to always model appropriate behavior. That means that you should not encounter me doing the following things*:

* Staying late in the office; I usually head home by 6pm
* Working on weekends
* Using email or Slack off-hours
* Scheduling meetings very early or very late in the day

Given that I try to not do these myself, it would be unfair of me to expect you to. If you find me not leading by example --by exhibiting the above (or other) behaviors or encouraging behavior from you that leads to poor balance of work with life-- please voice your objection. The most likely explanation is that I did not consciously realize I was doing this and speaking up will help me to correct course.

I prefer people to work smarter and not harder. If you find that you're needing to work well beyond 40 hours to be successful in your role, we should have a conversation about what adjustments can be made to make this not the case.

_*The obvious exception here is emergency situations._

## Communicating With Me

My primary guideline for communication is to consider what channel is most appropriate for our interaction. If you're looking for more than five minutes of back-and-forth, let's talk in person. If you have a quick question, Slack is great. Just trying to disseminate some non-urgent information to a broad group? Email seems like a solid choice. Here's a few other details about how I operate with each channel:

### Talking

I'm happy to make time to discuss something in-person whenever you need to, whether that's scheduled via a meeting or ad-hoc. For the latter, a heads up on Slack is cool or just stop by and give me a good old-fashioned tap on the shoulder. If I've got my headphones on it typically means I'm focused on something but that should never stop you from interrupting me. Again, you're my first priority.

### Slack

Generally, the easiest way to get in touch with me. I try to stay on top of Slack and respond in less than an hour during the workday. The one complication is that I'm frequently in meetings. It's my goal to be focused in a meeting and not doing other things. I typically play catch up on Slack between meetings. In the event that I'll need more time to respond, I will try to let you know that.

### Email

I'm quite averse to it and try to spend as little time as possible dealing with it. Typically, I'll lump my email processing into a morning session and an afternoon session. However, if the day is full, this can slip. When something is urgent, please do not use email or we're both going to have a sad time.

### PagerDuty

If it's off-hours and urgent, please page me.

### Mobile phone

I generally try to avoid disseminating my mobile number at work. If you think you'll need it, let's talk.

### Social media
Nope.

## Bugs // Quirks

* Direct and intense
* Fast talker, tendency to ramble
* Stubborn
* Better at starting than finishing
* Get bored easily

## My Story

I've traversed an atypical path into Engineering Management. Here's my lifestory in a nutshell to provide you some insight into the road I've traveled to now.

### Chapter 1: NOVA

* I grew up outside of Washington, DC in a nice corner of Northern Virginia.
* In my youth, I spent a lot of my time playing soccer and videogames and reading. My Dad worked for DOD so we had a computer in my house about as early as I can remember.
* I first began writing code at the age of 12 because I wanted to build a website for my Diablo guild. It had a lot of animated .gifs and I thought it was the coolest.
* In high school, I was fortunate that my school had computer science courses and I began programming in C++ in 10th grade. I talked my mom into getting two whiteboards for my bedroom so I could plan out programs at home.
* I played lacrosse for a state championship-winning team and made All-State playing bass clarinet.

### Chapter 2: State College
* Enrolled at Penn State University to study Computer Science.
* About two years in, I got freaked out about being pigeon-holed as a programmer in a cubicle for the rest of my life. In a moment of panic, I switched my major to Electrical Engineering.
* Focused my EE degree on optics, lasers, and antenna design.
* Loved being in college so much that I stuck around for a super-duper senior year. I think anyone who only goes for a fifth year of undergrad isn't truly dedicated to the cause.
* Finally graduated with what I'm sure is one of the lowest GPAs in PSU Engineering history for someone who actually completed a degree.

### Chapter 3: Various

* Moved back to NOVA and took a job as an EE with a large government contractor.
* Spent the next three years working on full-scale military flight simulators and sliding into misery.
* Met my now-wife and let her convince me we should both quit our jobs we didn't like. She took a traveling contract gig and we set off, me having zero plan about what I would do for my career. The only certainty was that I didn't want to be an EE any longer.
* Ended up in Houston, TX for a year. Tried to jumpstart a freelance writing career. Made about $250 total but had some cool experiences.
* Started bartending and teaching SAT prep classes to help with bills. Realized neither of these were great longterm options and that I should be doing something more with my life.
* Decided to try to get back into software engineering, my first passion, and move to the mecca for it, San Francisco.

### Chapter 4: San Francisco

* Joined AngelPoints, a cool 14-person startup building a platform for Corporate Social Responsibility, as a Professional Services Engineer with the plan of transitioning to a Software Engineer role. Fell in love with mission-driven business, building modern software, and San Francisco.
* AngelPoints is acquired, VP of Eng leaves, sadness ensues.
* Joined Opower, a rapidly growing mid-sized startup focused on driving energy efficiency using behavioral science, as an Associate Professional Services Engineer.
* Spent the next 2.5 years rising through the PSE ranks and taking on some of the most complex projects the group had. Began managing a delivery team with several direct reports.
* Transitioned into Engineering to manage team focused on internal tools development. Spent about six months as an individual contributor and learning the tech stack before fully transitioning into EM role. Spent my last two years at Opower managing this team in various incarnations.
* Oracle acquires Opower, 40% of Engineering leaves, sadness ensues.
* Joined Optimizely, a rapidly growing mid-sized startup focused on digital experimentation, as an Engineering Manager for the Frontend Engineering team.

## Management Philosophy

* __Measuring stick for success:__ Can someone go out and get a better role after you’ve been their manager? You’ve got to care about the development of people to your core. My direct reports are my highest priority.
* __Put people and the team first:__ Constantly ask, what can I do to be most helpful to you or the team? The most helpful thing you can do may be totally different day-to-day, week-to-week, person-to-person, or team-to-team. Default to the assumption that you’re the worst on the team and treat everyone else like they’re more awesome than you. If you’ve hired right, that will be true.
* __Constant improvement:__ Make this a fundamental value for both individuals and the team itself. Don’t set anything in stone. Don’t assume you’re ever doing something perfect. When you’ve made one improvement, move onto the next thing. Repeat forever.
* __How to move mountains:__ Give a properly motivated team a high degree of trust and autonomy.
* __Achieving motivation:__ Help everyone understand the value of what the team is doing and what they as an individual are doing. Make sure everyone knows priorities and reasoning behind them. Be transparent and honest about goals. Keep their growth central to your focus and make it a part of their everyday life.
* __Autonomy:__ let teams decide for themselves how they best operate. Actively seek out new ideas. When someone has an idea, consider it with an open mind and err on the side of trying new things. You can always revert if something doesn’t work. Don’t micromanage someone’s day or their work.
* __Create a safe and comfortable psychological space__: Strive to craft this work environment for engineers and teams. Encourage them to share their ideas. Listen to those opinions//feedback. Take action on what you’re hearing. Foster a culture of blameless criticism.
* __Management is important and valuable__: I've been fortunate to have great managers that I've learned so much from. I try to provide that experience to everyone I work with. I’ve also seen the negative impacts of bad management and lack of management.
* __Feedback is vital:__ Give pointed, direct feedback on a regular basis. Don’t wait for an annual review to help someone improve. Try to generalize negative feedback and be specific with positive feedback.
* __Diverse teams make the best decisions__: This seems obvious but software industry demographics indicates it is not. Seek out a variety of backgrounds and talent profiles when building a team.

# Personal README

## What is this?

Think of this as documentation for Matthew Root. Its intended purpose is to accelerate your understanding of me as a human and Engineering Manager. It is __not__ intended as a substitute for getting to know me. Building a relationship, in real life, is one of the most important things we'll do together. This README should be used as a supplement and a guide rather than a replacement for that.

## Management Philosophy

The following are the core tenets that provide the foundation for how I prefer to manage. I strive to adhere to these all the time. If you ever find me to be in violation of one of these ideas, please point it out to me. That will help me do better in the future.

* __Measuring stick for success:__ Can someone go out and get a better role after you’ve been their manager? You’ve got to care about the development of people to your core. Make your direct reports are your highest priority.
* __Put people and the team first:__ Constantly ask, what can I do to be most helpful to you or the team? The most helpful thing you can do may be totally different day-to-day, week-to-week, person-to-person, or team-to-team. Default to the assumption that you’re the worst on the team and treat everyone else like they’re more awesome than you. If you’ve hired right, that will be true.
* __Constant improvement:__ Make this a fundamental value for both individuals and the team itself. Don’t set anything in stone. Don’t assume you’re ever doing something perfect. When you’ve made one improvement, move onto the next thing. Repeat forever.
* __How to move mountains:__ Give a properly motivated team a high degree of trust and autonomy.
* __Achieving motivation:__ Help everyone understand the value of what the team is doing and what they as an individual are doing. Make sure everyone knows priorities and reasoning behind them. Be transparent and honest about goals. Keep their growth central to your focus and make it a part of their everyday life.
* __Autonomy:__ Let teams decide for themselves how they best operate. Actively seek out new ideas. When someone has an idea, consider it with an open mind and err on the side of trying new things. You can always revert if something doesn’t work. Don’t micromanage someone’s day or their work.
* __Create a safe and comfortable psychological space__: Strive to craft this work environment for engineers and teams. Encourage them to share their ideas. Listen to those opinions//feedback. Take action on what you’re hearing. Foster a culture of blameless criticism.
* __Management is important and valuable__: I've been fortunate to have great managers that I've learned so much from. I try to provide that experience to everyone I work with. I’ve also seen the negative impacts of bad management and lack of management.
* __Feedback is vital:__ Give pointed, direct feedback on a regular basis. Don’t wait for an annual review to help someone improve. Try to generalize negative feedback and be specific with positive feedback. Additionally, seek out feedback from those you work with, in all directions, in order to drive your own growth.
* __Diverse teams make the best decisions__: This may seem obvious but software industry demographics indicate it is not. Seek out a variety of backgrounds and talent profiles when building a team.

## Communicating With Me

My primary guideline for communication is to consider what channel is most appropriate for our interaction. If you're looking for more than five minutes of back-and-forth, let's talk in person. If you have a quick question, Slack is great. Just trying to disseminate some non-urgent information to a broad group? Email seems like a solid choice. Here's a few other details about how I operate with each channel:

### Talking

I'm happy to make time to discuss something in-person whenever you need to, whether that's scheduled via a meeting or ad-hoc. For the latter, a heads up on Slack is cool or just stop by and give me a good old-fashioned tap on the shoulder. If I've got my headphones on it typically means I'm focused on something but that should never stop you from interrupting me. Again, you're my first priority.

### Slack

Generally, the easiest way to get in touch with me. I try to stay on top of Slack and respond in less than an hour during the workday. The one complication is that I'm frequently in meetings. It's my goal to be focused in a meeting and not doing other things. I typically play catch up on Slack between meetings. In the event that I'll need more time to respond, I will try to let you know that.

### Email

I'm quite averse to it and try to spend as little time as possible dealing with it. Typically, I'll lump my email processing into a morning session and an afternoon session. However, if the day is full, this can slip. When something is urgent, please do not use email or we're both going to have a sad time.

### PagerDuty

If it's off-hours and urgent, please page me.

### Mobile phone

I generally try to avoid disseminating my mobile number at work. If you think you'll need it, let's talk.

### Social media
Nope.

## My Story

I've traversed an atypical path into Engineering Management. Here's my lifestory in a nutshell to provide you some insight into the road I've traveled to now.

### Chapter 1: NOVA

* I grew up outside of Washington, DC in a nice corner of Northern Virginia.
* In my youth, I spent a lot of my time playing soccer and videogames and reading. My Dad worked for DOD so we had a computer in my house about as early as I can remember.
* I first began writing code at the age of 12 because I wanted to build a website for my Diablo guild. It had a lot of animated .gifs and I thought it was the coolest.
* In high school, I was fortunate that my school had computer science courses and I began programming in C++ in 10th grade. I talked my mom into getting two whiteboards for my bedroom so I could plan out programs at home.
* I played lacrosse for a state championship-winning team and made All-State playing bass clarinet.

### Chapter 2: State College
* Enrolled at Penn State University to study Computer Science.
* About two years in, I got freaked out about being pigeon-holed as a programmer in a cubicle for the rest of my life. In a moment of panic, I switched my major to Electrical Engineering.
* Focused my EE degree on optics, lasers, and antenna design.
* Loved being in college so much that I stuck around for a super-duper senior year. I think anyone who only goes for a fifth year of undergrad isn't truly dedicated to the cause.
* Finally graduated with what I'm sure is one of the lowest GPAs in PSU Engineering history for someone who actually completed a degree.

### Chapter 3: Various

* Moved back to NOVA and took a job as an EE with a large government contractor.
* Spent the next three years working on full-scale military flight simulators and sliding into misery.
* Met my now-wife and let her convince me we should both quit our jobs we didn't like. She took a traveling contract gig and we set off, me having zero plan about what I would do for my career. The only certainty was that I didn't want to be an EE any longer.
* Ended up in Houston, TX for a year. Tried to jumpstart a freelance writing career. Made about $250 total but had some cool experiences.
* Started bartending and teaching SAT prep classes to help with bills. Realized neither of these were great longterm options and that I should be doing something more with my life.
* Decided to try to get back into software engineering, my first passion, and move to the mecca for it, San Francisco.

### Chapter 4: San Francisco

* Joined AngelPoints, a cool 14-person startup building a platform for Corporate Social Responsibility, as a Professional Services Engineer with the plan of transitioning to a Software Engineer role. Fell in love with mission-driven business, building modern software, and San Francisco.
* AngelPoints is acquired, VP of Eng leaves, sadness ensues.
* Joined Opower, a rapidly growing mid-sized startup focused on driving energy efficiency using behavioral science, as an Associate Professional Services Engineer.
* Spent the next 2.5 years rising through the PSE ranks and taking on some of the most complex projects the group had. Began managing a delivery team with several direct reports.
* Transitioned into Engineering to manage team focused on internal tools development. Spent about six months as an individual contributor and learning the tech stack before fully transitioning into EM role. Spent my last two years at Opower managing this team in various incarnations.
* Oracle acquires Opower, 40% of Engineering leaves, sadness ensues.
* Joined Optimizely, a rapidly growing mid-sized startup focused on digital experimentation, as an Engineering Manager for the Frontend Engineering team.
